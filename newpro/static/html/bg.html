Besant Gardens are considered to be the largest green space in Chennai.
This place is kind of dreamy and feels straight out of a book.
Being part of the Theosophical society this location has a plethora of history associated with it.
It is an amazing area to visit and enjoy the serenity and tranquility of this region. 
This trail is great for birding, hiking, and road biking,
