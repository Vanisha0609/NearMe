Besant Nagar Beach also known as Edward Elliot's Beach
It is said that once a Danish sailor, Karl Schmidt, sacrificed his life while saving a man from drowning in the sea. 
A monument has been constructed in his honour at the beach and named as “Elliots”.
Several multi-cuisine restaurants and street side cafes adorn the shores of the beach.
Sea foods are one of the key attractions of the beach where you can enjoy the fried fish delicacies with the South Indian dishes.
You can witness the amazing sunrise and sunset at the beach, with the sky being painted by the golden rays of the sun.
the site is perfect for the ones who want to soak their feet in the splashing sea water 
and lose themselves entirely in the arms of nature
